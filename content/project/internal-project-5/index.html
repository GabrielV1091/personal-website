<p>As many sea side communities are aware of, the threat of rising sea levels will displace many people and even erase entire countries. While being able to reshelter environmental refugees is important and critical for the future, what happens to historical objects that are left behind? Itâ€™s entirely possible to transfer small artifacts or tokens, but what of much larger historical figures such as statues, gardens, streets, or entire buildings? Many of these historical landmarks are inherently tied to and have cultural significance in the places they are located. With rising sea levels, how should communities decide what to preserve or leave behind? The following map will show potentially lost historical landmarks within the city of Boston as designated by the Boston Landmark Commission due to rising sea levels.</p>

<p>From this map, we can see specific areas of Boston, particularly Seaport, parts of Downtown, and North End, would be the most affected by a moderate sea level rise. At this level, the entire Fort Point district would be lost as well as nearly 22 landmarks in the downtown Boston area. Many of these landmarks are churches, or buildings such as Faneuil Hall. For preservation, it is important for conditions to remain as stable as possible and any potential risk needs to be addressed quickly. While at 36 inch sea level increase is already devastating to several landmarks, what would happen if sea levels further increased? How would communities preserve entire neighborhoods such as Back Bay or the Boston Commons? Additionally, this sea level increase is not including any catastrophic event such as a 10 or 100 year flood which would cause even greater damage to the city. Environmental sustainability and resilience will continue to play an ever increasing role in our society and while making sure people and their communities have a home, landmarks that cannot be recreated also need to be considered in these situations for continued preservation.</p>
