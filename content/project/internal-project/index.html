<p>A pandemic on the scale of Covid-19 has done a lot to change our understanding on how businesses and people can survive and function. Having such a high element of uncertainty poses the question on how to handle it. Some individuals may choose to operation as close to normal as possible, maintaining a sense of consistency and others may choose to be more conservative in their actions in order to try and survive for an unknown amount of time. It depends on who or what industries they are a part of or how they perceive the future to look. Many service industries and jobs are particularly affected by how the mechanics of the virus and how it spreads while other data analytic jobs remain largely unchanged due to being able to operate online and using cloud computing services to maintain and distribute their information. This post will briefly explain one of the changes that have occurred specifically to the Airbnb business in Boston.</p>
<p>If we were to look at the median household income of 2019 in Boston, we would notice that not only is there an income inequality problem, the income is skewed towards the towards the peripherals of Boston. The peripheral neighborhoods, in this case, are Back Bay and Jamaica Plain whereas center
neighborhoods would be Roxbury and Mattapan. As such, different neighborhoods with different levels of Airbnb activity have greater potential lost revenue from the pandemic.</p>

<p>Here we can see the total potential loss by census tract. There are a couple of noteworthy details to point out. First, the vast majority of tracts fall into the lowest category. Based on the proximity to the downtown area, this is generally not surprising, as hosts will try to have listings
available to the city attractions as well as basing the prices of the cost of living in the area in order to maintain the property. Downtown, Back Bay, and Fenway generally are more expensive overall so hosts will adjust their pricing to match. An exception to this would be the neighborhood of
West Roxbury, whose median income is towards the higher end but shows a low potential loss of income.</p>
<p>We can conclude a few things from this. Areas that have higher economic activity have much greater immediate losses due to the loss of businesses but, most importantly, can also recover much faster than other communities. While these areas may need the most amount of help, they do not need long term help. The long term help should be given to communities that do not have a lot of activity, as they would not be able to recover as quickly.</p>
